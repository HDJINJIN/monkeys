- Clean up unused files/packages
- Dependabot

- Add undo function or add end turn button and make tile draggable until clicked
- Pull rules list into separate file from tutorial JS (see profile for example)
- More tests
- Force landscape mode if screen width is below certain size
- images are slow. Make smaller? Cache? SVG tiles???
- would be cool to change color of route to indicate owner
- make rules swipe-able on mobile
- check color accessibility
