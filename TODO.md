- remove modal and render different components instead
- use css grid for rules?
- switch to copy instead of favicon generator
- change background color on maskable icon to be sandy

- Add undo function or add end turn button and make tile draggable until clicked
- More tests
- Force landscape mode if screen width is below certain size
- images are slow. Minimize/make smaller? Cache? SVG tiles???
- would be cool to change color of route to indicate owner
- make rules swipe-able on mobile?
- check color accessibility
